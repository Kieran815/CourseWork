1. In your own words, explain the React core concept of encapsulation. Discuss why this React principle is important in application development.

Encapsulation is a way to be able to reuse components multiple times throughout
a project whether they are class or class based or functional components. You
can program them to do basic functions or receive state and props as part of a
class based component that can send the results back to the main app to be
used elsewhere. I've been looking at it like legos, in that you can snap in
and remove them do make a web app.
