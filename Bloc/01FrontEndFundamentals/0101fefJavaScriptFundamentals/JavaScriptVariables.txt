1. camelCasing, i.e. `myName` or `intValue`

2. var mentorName = 'John Flecko';

3. console.log(mentorName);

4. `var` is a constant with a global scope (applies to entire code block or page), `let` allows you to set a var that can change, and `const` is a variable that will not be reassigned.



Code Practice:
```
var name = 'Kieran';
	const location = 'Illinois';
	let hairColor = 'Brown';
```
