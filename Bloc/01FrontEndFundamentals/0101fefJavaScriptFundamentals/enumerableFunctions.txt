//1. `map()` takes an existing array, applies data, then creates
// a new array from the original, while leaving the existing array in place.

//2. `filter()` searches an array and excludes items that do not fit a set of
// conditions.

//3. the difference between the map() and filter() is that map() applies changes to
// every item in an array and logs the results, while filter() is used to excludes
// items from the original array.

//numbers that are greater than three, then use the reduce() function to sum the
