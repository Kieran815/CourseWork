1. Don't Repeat Yourself, as a way to make code more concise and streamlined. You can assign functions to tasks instead of having to write the same code over and over.

2. write = function declaration, where you create the function to do the task
   execute = invoke function, where declared function operates

3. Parameters are the variable spots in the function that are defined by the argument data to produce the output.

4. Mutating functions will are functions that will change the array of a data set. Non-Mutating functions will produce the total new objects or structures.

`````
var shoppingCart = [20, 15];

function getTotalCost(prices){
  let total = 0;
  // code below
  for (i = 0; i < prices.length; i++)
    total += prices[i];
  // code above
  return total;
}

getTotalCost(shoppingCart);
```
