// 1. What are the typical Agile team roles and what parts of the development
// lifecycle is each role responsible for?
//   Product Manager(Owner)- overall management of product development strategy,
// roadmap, and features, which can be added or removed over the course of
// development.
//   Designer- oversees look/feel of a product via mark-up designs, wire frames,
// and desired interactions for the product.
//   User Researcher- uses user feedback data to help the development team to
// create the product with the end-user in mind.
//   Team Lead- development leader who is responsible for the technical
// management, direction, and overall quality of the product. Depending on the
// product or project, a Team Lead may or may not be an individual contributor.
//   Developer- responsible for technical creation/execution, maintenance, and
// overall integrity of a product/project.

// 2. Why do we use Kanban boards in Agile development?
//    Kanban Boards are a way for a development team to stay organized and aware
// of the projects overall completion. They can include columns for:
//   Backlog- cards of the completed work
//   Committed- upcoming work
//   Blocked- items that cannot be completed for various reasons
//   In Progress- work the team is currently doing
//   In Test- items that are being tested before being added to the project
//   Deployed- live parts of the project that are awaiting final approval
//   Approved- work that has been approved by the client

// 3. Explain velocity and sprint as if you were teaching another student.
//    A Sprint is a block of time that a developer has to get a part of the
// project up and running. During that time, the team will have regular dev
// meetings.
//    On the front end, the team will meet about prioritization (team
// covers what goals for sprint are), estimation (estimating time and complexity
// of the work in the sprint), and planning (committing to goals for the sprint,
// based on estimation), then on the back end, meet about Review (go over
// completed work that is in production with the product owner or client) and
// Retrospective (going back over completed work to make adjustments).
//    Velocity is the number of checkpoints the development team completes during
// the current sprint.

// 4. What format makes a good user story?
//    User stories are a way for a team to come up with ideas for product
// functions. They help to get a better idea of what tasks the user wants to
// accomplish in an effort to specify what work or Cards the team should
// complete. A good format for a user story is:
//        "As a ____, I want (to) ____, so ________"

// 5. What are different estimation methods teams can use? Explain pros and cons
// of each method. Which method would you prefer?
//     T-Shirt Size: Estimating how large the current sprint is by the work to
// be completed.
//    Planning Poker: the dev team use playing cards to come to a concensus on a
// particular estimation.
//    Bucket System: team estimates items by placing them in buckets, then follows
// with a group discussion to come to a concensus.

// 6. Give a real-world example of a development project, and explain the
// breakdown into epic(s), slices, cards, and tasks.

// 7. Explain in your own words what a dual-track system is and what advantages
// it provides.
//   Dual-Track is a way to have both the Discovery side (Designers, User
// Researchers, and the Product Owner (client)) and the Delivery side
// (Project Manager, Team Lead(s), and Developers) work on a project at the same
// time so that neither side has downtime and can stay productive throughout
// development.


// 8. Choose one of the following projects and write each card that would be in
// the epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your
// Kanban board?

// Card: Estimation, User Story, Tasks, Epic, other relevent data
