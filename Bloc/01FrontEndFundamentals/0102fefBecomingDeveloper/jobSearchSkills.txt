Interpersonal Communication
8.75: I am transitioning from a professional sales career, where interpersonal 
communication is key for building long-term relationships with key decision makers.

Accountability
9: I own up to mistakes and failures and use them as learning opportunities and 
guidance for ways to grow myself personally and professionally.

Technical Skills
4: I am brand new to programming and have gone through the basic html, css, and 
JavaScript lessons from bloc, but have since gone on to additional educational 
sites to supplement and build off of what Bloc has started me on.

Technical Communication

4: Still Working on learning, but I feel like I am making good progress in 
establishing a long-term foundation for a development career. I can walk through 
my code and explain what's going on, especially in html and css, though I am still
learning the finer points of JavaScript

Confidence
8: This is what I want to be doing. I get great satisfaction from looking back at a 
project I was working on and seeing the end result. So far, this has been a mostly
worthwhile experience for me, though again I am still learning.

Resilience and Grit
10: I have had a crap three months. The fact that I am still in it to win it speaks
volumes to me about my personal character and drive. Most other people would have
cracked. I have not.
